        <h1>monochrome by the sundays</h1>
        <p>It's 4 in the morning July of '69</p>
        <p>Me and my sister</p>
        <p>We crept down like shadows</p>
        <p>They're bringing the moon right down to our sitting-room</p>
        <p>Static and silence and a monochrome vision</p>
        <br />
        <p>They're dancing around</p>
        <p>Slow puppets silver ground</p>
        <p>And the world was watching with joy</p>
        <p>We hear a voice from above and it's history</p>
        <p>And we stayed awake all night</p>
        <br />
        <p>And something is said and the whole room laughs aloud</p>
        <p>Me and my sister</p>
        <p>Looking on like shadows</p>
        <p>The end of an age as we watched them walk in a glow</p>
        <p>Lost in space, but I don't know where it is</p>
        <br />
        <p>They're dancing around</p>
        <p>Slow puppets silver ground</p>
        <p>And the stars and stripes in the sand</p>
        <p>We hear a voice from above and it's history</p>
        <p>And we stayed awake all night</p>
        <br />
        <p>They're dancing around</p>
        <p>It sends a shiver down my spine</p>
        <p>And I run to look in the sky and</p>
        <p>I half expect to hear them asking to come down</p>
        <p>Oh, will they fly or will they fall?</p>
        <p>To be excited by a long late night</p>
