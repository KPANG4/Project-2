# project overview

for my project 2, i decided on the song "monochrome" by the sundays. I chose this song to represent community because it reminds me a lot of childhood nostalgia and the special bond I have with my sisters. Whenever I listen to this song, I think of really happy moments much like described in the song but memories of my own. I also really like how I view this song visually. The lyrics paint a lot of images in my head and I feel like I can do a lot with that when it comes to designing a website and laying everything out. I can picture it being very beautifully and aesthetically cohesive!

# technical overview

The layout style I chose was a long scroll. As you scroll down the page, you read the lyrics and see the animations I chose to make the message stand out.
